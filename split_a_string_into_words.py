text = """Let me be your hero
Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me cryin'?
And would you save my soul tonight?
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh, please, tell me this
Now, would you die for the one you loved?
Hold me in your arms tonight
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my very breath away
Would you swear that you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
